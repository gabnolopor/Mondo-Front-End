# Mondo-Front-End
Web design and developement for MONDO, a health and bodycare center in Sevilla, Spain.

I made use of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript in order to create a website with special care on the graphic and code design, making it atractive to the viewer and 
useful in any device or browser (excepting for a few details in TorBrowser).
Most media was retrieved from stock photography websites and free icon dispensers. The media in the About us section was obtained and edited by me so it could meet the quality standards intended.
